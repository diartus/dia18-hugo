Solo show at Galerie Metro, Berlin | April 10 – May 14, 2010
<!--more-->

The show was approaching the topic of all-embracing separation and isolation and in doing so reflecting the condition and state of mind of the contemporary autonomous and flexible individual.  The works examine the idea of ‘separation’ from various perspectives and were combined as a fragmented narration, using different ways of production and presentation.
