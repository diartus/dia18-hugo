A recurring motif in my photographic work are veiled buildings. I am interested in the state of transition, of ‘passage’ and ‘promise’ reflected here, the vagueness of appearance and shape. I reproduce and duplicate the veiling by the way I install this images, mounting them to the wall with packing tape and adding new layers of wrapping until they are almost totally covered. The condition of the particular space becomes part of the installation. After the exhibition’s end I remove the tape and by doing so, huge parts of the image get lost. I preserve the leftovers from the old exhibits as documents in frames. Within the process of installation the image thus passes through a sort of reversed maintenance resulting in its partial disappearance.
