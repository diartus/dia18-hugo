Diana Artus is a visual artist dealing with the perception of urban space and its imagery as well as with topics like narration, memory production, the ambiguous nature of desire, contemporary concepts of love and self-constitution. She is especially interested in the interdependency between city and mood and explores public representation and urban objects from an associative-metaphorical point of view. Photography provides the base of her creative process resulting in reinterpretations of urban phenomena and architectural bodies, often taking the form of sculptural image objects or images of images. In addition she also writes articles and essays to reflect on current conditions of work and creative production with a special focus on the sociology of art.

Artus’ art works evolve from all the material which comes across her way while strolling randomly through different cities: photographs she takes, found footage, visual/textual notes. She uses a small digital camera serving as seismographic device to record ‚psychogeographic shocks‘ – the accidential, the provisional, the fragile and the contradictory are especially attractive to the artist. After finding their way into her archive these photographs later initiate a process of analog transformation, consisting of repeated reproduction, distortions and interferences, error and interactions between ‚outer’ and ‚inner’ images. The limits of the photographic medium are constantly stretched and transcended, transforming digital photographs into unique originals characterized by an analog character and a haptic materiality.


Besides Diana Artus also started to extensively work with old photo novel magazines found on South European flea markets, subjecting their imagery, characters and stories to an actualization and recontextualization with the aim to revisit and to reuse this genre and its narrative potential.
